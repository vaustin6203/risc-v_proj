# risc-v_proj
A simple RISC-V classification system. Implemented basic mathematical functions ReLU, ArgMax, dot product, and matrix multiplication. Also implemented the ability to read and write matrices to binary files includinf fopen, fread, fwrite, and fclose. This was a group project and was written entirely in RISC-V assembly.
